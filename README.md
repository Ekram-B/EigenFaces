# EigenFaces

The EigenFaces algorithm is a PCA based algorithm and is an example of unsupervised learning. This algorithm was implemented for as an assignment- the task of which was to implement and apply dimensionality reduction for classification problems. 

To apply Eigenfaces - one must have knowledge of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and the Kth nearest neighbor model. 

Using the following paper was used as an aid.
