# EigenFaces

The EigenFaces algorithm is a PCA based algorithm and is an example of unsupervised learning. For this assignment, the input
to be considered will be images of faces. The assignment will explore the problem of both face recognition (i.e., does an image
contain a face) and person recognition (i.e., whose face is in this image).

To apply Eigenfaces - one must have knowledge of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and the Kth nearest neighbor model. 

Using the following paper was used as an aid.
