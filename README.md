# EigenFaces

The EigenFaces algorithm is a PCA based algorithm and is an example of unsupervised learning. The algorithm is used for face recognition. For this implementation - when the program is ready to test, we will use the AT&T databse of faces. To apply Eigenfaces - one must have knowledge of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and the Kth nearest neighbor model. 

Status - implementation is not completed yet! This is a recreational project.
